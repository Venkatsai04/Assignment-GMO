Grow Me Organic â€“ React Assignment

Live - [text](https://assignment-gmo.netlify.app)

This project is my submission for the Grow Me Organic React assignment.
It implements a server-side paginated data table using React + PrimeReact, showing artwork data from the API.
Features include:

12 rows per page with smooth pagination.
Row selection with checkboxes (persisting across pages).
A custom bulk-select option where you can enter the number of rows to select, even across multiple pages.
Fresh state on reload (local storage is cleared).
This assignment reflects my ability to build clean, scalable, and user-friendly UI components.
